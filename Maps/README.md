# Maps

This repository contains code I've found useful for generating maps.

For manusripts, often my preference has been to generate maps in ArcGIS (and therefore code is not present here). However, I will add code to this repository as and when I generate a figure that I feel should be saved for future reference.

This code is a simplified version of that used to produce Figure 3 in Brockerhoff et al. (2023)
